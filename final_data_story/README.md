# Blog post: COMM318 Final Project Data Story
## What Makes Songs Popular on Spotify and Billboard?

You've reached our final data blog post! It explains our project and poses the question – based on the audio metrics we have, are songs which chart on Spotify sonically different than songs which chart on Billboard and if so, how? In answering our main question, we explored things like...

- Are Spotify-charting songs longer than Billboard-charting songs?
- Do Billboard-charting songs have more danceability, energy, or valence than Spotify-charting songs?
- Are there more explicit songs on the Spotify-charts than the Billboard charts?

...and more!

Our project is conceived of as a blog post, weaving together both code and text in a way that is understandable and engaging. Our article should feel accessible to anyone – those involved in music (i.e. artists, music industry professionals), data analytics in media, or just folks who like to listen to good songs! We hope it provides more insight on how the music industry is changing especially with the rise of Spotify and starts conversations about shifts in popular music nowadays. 

Our story is located in this folder via the notebook: Are Songs Popular On the Spotify and Billboard Charts All That Different?.ipynb. The img_datastory subfolder contains image files used in our blog post.

We hope you enjoy reading and take something away from our project!
