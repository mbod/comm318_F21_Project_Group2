## Data files for COMM318 Group Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.
    
spotify2020raw.csv contains the raw, uncleaned track-level metrics gathered using Spotipy based on the songs in the Top Tracks of 2020 USA Playlist. 

spotify2020cleaned.csv contains the same tracks/rows as spotify2020raw.csv, although some cleanup (column removal and renaming, unit conversions) has been applied.
