    "The columns represent a variety of track-level metrics. \"Unnamed: 0\" can be taken to mean the popularity ranking of the top 98 songs at the end of 2017 (as it begins at 0, this column includes data ranging from 0 - 97). Several other columns are easily understandable labels or objective measures, such as song name, album title, artist, release date, duration_ms (duration of the song in milliseconds). \n",
    "\n",
    "Other columns straddle the line between objective and subjectively determined measures, likely involving some automated / machine learning methods on Spotify's end. The column 'explicit' represents a categorical variable denoting if a track has explicit lyrics - true meaning yes and false meaning no or unknown. The column 'tempo' represents the speed of the track in beats per minute. The column 'time signature' represents the meter of the song; however, I can already tell there are significant mistakes in time signature labeling of songs, meaning that Spotify's machine learning models may be unreliable for this metric; I will likely remove this column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A significant portion of columns, such as danceability, energy, instrumentalness, valence, etc. are Spotify-defined metrics entirely defined by machine learning algorithms. Fuller descriptions of these variables and the others previously mentioned can be found [here](https://rpubs.com/PeterDola/SpotifyTracks).\n",
    "\n",
    "The column 'popularity' is important to understand. It contains values between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. Algorithmically calculated, it is determined based on number of plays and how recent those plays are. Especially since this dataset was gathered long after 2017 (meaning that the 'popularity' algorithm has taken into account listening patterns from 2018-2021) , the values in the 'popularity' column are no longer relevant and no longer match up to the ranked order of songs in the dataset. Thus, I will also disregard and remove this column."
